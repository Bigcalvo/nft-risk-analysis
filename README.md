You can download the entire zip, then open the Pulsquares.html file to get a view of the graph visualization of transactions for a specific collection. The Pulsquares_Network_Graph.ipynb outputs the aforementioned HTML file. Graph_Based_Analysis_of_Wash_Trade_Patterns.ipynb outputs the collection_wash_trades.csv file, which contains insights an quantities of risky tokens for the ~7 million transactions analyzed. This notebook and its associated CSV rely on a SQLite database that was too large to upload to GitHub, so the notebook cannot be run.
